# UPC 1ACC0238 Mobile course runway

Isolated academic projection for **Aplicaciones para Dispositivos Móviles**,
period `202620`, NRC `4949`, team `nexa-team`. This folder contains only
derived planning and evidence maps; the external course source is intentionally
not stored in the publishable Blueprint tree. These documents do not copy
academic authority into Nexa Product, Domain or Architecture.

## Authority boundary

- `01-shared` owns accepted Product, Domain, Architecture and delivery rules.
- `03-mobile` owns the Mobile Product projection and canonical story behavior.
- `90-academic/courses/mobile-1acc0238` owns course mapping, backlog projection,
  milestone readiness and evidence status. The course projection intentionally
  remains V1-only; the Product runway is indexed in the [Master Mobile Product
  Backlog](../../../../03-mobile/requirements/master-mobile-backlog.md).
- `91-reference` owns historical and external evidence.
- The external course statement is an input constraint only; its source file is
  local-only and is not a publishable Blueprint artifact.

No interview, persona, statistic, paper, provider credential, deployment,
physical-device run, video or Product Acceptance result is claimed without
attached evidence. `READY` means structurally prepared; it does not mean
implemented or accepted.

| Native constraint | Android / Kotlin | TARGET ACADEMIC CONSTRAINT |
| Cross-platform constraint | Flutter/Dart or Kotlin Multiplatform/Kotlin | TARGET ACADEMIC CONSTRAINT; choice OPEN |
| Local storage | Required, non-authoritative in Nexa V1 | TARGET DEFINED; client evidence pending |

| Languages | English `en_US`; Latin American Spanish `es_419` | TARGET DEFINED; Mobile client pending |
| Accessibility | Mobile a11y evidence required | TARGET DEFINED; validation pending |

## Owner four-week outcome

The owner goal is an Android-native foundation plus a representative core flow
defined and implementation-ready within approximately four weeks, preferably
demonstrable on a physical Android device. It is a delivery target, not a
claim that the Mobile client exists.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| READY | Structure and source links exist; evidence may still be absent. |
| STRUCTURE_READY | Required section/schema exists; content or artifact remains pending. |
| RESEARCH_PENDING | Interviews, validation or external decision not evidenced. |
| OWNER_INPUT_REQUIRED | A Product, Architecture, Design or team decision is needed. |
| IMPLEMENTATION_PENDING | No verified client/runtime artifact exists. |
| VERIFIED WITH CAVEAT | Evidence exists but scope or maturity boundary remains. |
| NOT APPLICABLE | Rubric item does not apply to current bounded scope; rationale recorded. |

Current course readiness is **STRUCTURE_READY with implementation and research
gates open**.
