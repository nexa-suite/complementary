# 1ACC0238 Mobile requirements projection

> GENERATED ACADEMIC PROJECTION — DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY

Canonical source: [Mobile V1 catalog](../../../../03-mobile/requirements/mobile-v1-catalog.md).
Product runway source (not part of this course backlog): [Master Mobile Product
Backlog](../../../../03-mobile/requirements/master-mobile-backlog.md).
This projection preserves only the 28 Mobile V1 stories selected by the Product
Surface Scope Amendment / Rebaseline. Every row repeats the functional story
description and Gherkin scenarios so the academic artifact is readable without
delegating its required fields to a link. Research, implementation and Product
Acceptance remain open; no client, device, interview or provider evidence is
invented.

## Scope and course constraints

- Historical Mobile inventory: 49 retained IDs; final Product registry: 73;
  this course projection remains exactly 28 V1 rows.
- Academic V1 Epics: five. Product runway: twelve Epics across V1–V4/Future.
  The Epic model is outcome-based.
- V1 is online-first. Local persistence may support safe reads, harmless drafts,
  temporary evidence and retry metadata; it is not business authority.
- The academic native constraint is Android/Kotlin. A cross-platform option
  remains open for SPIKE-002; no framework is silently selected.
- The source course statement and rubric are intentionally excluded from the
  publishable Blueprint tree. This projection contains only derived planning.

  - Scenario: Repeat report — Given the outcome is unknown, when the operator retries the same report, then Nexa preserves one discrepancy fact.
  - Scenario: Disconnected note — Given the operator has no connection, when a report is drafted, then it is marked unconfirmed and cannot change sellable stock.

- **Owning Bounded Context:** BC-06 — Fulfillment & Delivery
- **Secondary Bounded Contexts:** BC-02 — Customer & Buyer Relationships; BC-11 — Business Traceability
- **Shared Capability:** CAP-09 — Fulfillment, dispatch and delivery
- **Business Goal / Impact:** the buyer can identify the correct delivery safely.
- **Research status:** PROPOSED / RESEARCH VALIDATION PENDING
- **Scope:** V1 candidate; Product Acceptance pending
- **Mobile justification:** Mobile-native physical or handoff work; business authority remains in Nexa.
- **Backend Support:** PARTIAL — API compatibility evidence; Mobile client absent
- **Implementation Evidence:** AS-IS API v0.17.0 compatibility evidence only; no verified Mobile client/runtime artifact.
- **Client Status:** NOT STARTED - no verified Mobile client/runtime artifact in the current baseline
- **Dependencies:** BC-06 — Fulfillment & Delivery; shared access, authorization, freshness and retry contracts.
- **Description / User Story:** As a Driver or Delivery Operator, I want to present a bounded delivery handoff code, so that the buyer can identify the correct delivery safely.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Four visible Gherkin scenarios; canonical catalog remains the behavior authority.
  - Scenario: Valid code — Given an active authorized Delivery, when the driver presents its code, then Nexa binds the code to that Delivery and Attempt.
  - Scenario: Expired or wrong code — Given a code is expired, reused or belongs to another Delivery, when it is checked, then Nexa rejects it without changing Delivery state.
  - Scenario: Code unavailable — Given the code cannot be presented, when the driver uses the approved fallback, then the handoff remains explicit and no false acceptance is recorded.
  - Scenario: Separate facts — Given the buyer verifies the code, when verification succeeds, then it does not by itself create receipt, POD, payment or Delivery completion.

- **Description / User Story:** As a Customer Buyer, I want to know when a delivery needs attention, so that I can respond to a relevant delivery change in time.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Four visible Gherkin scenarios; canonical catalog remains the behavior authority.
  - Scenario: Relevant update — Given a permitted Delivery fact needs buyer attention, when Nexa sends an update, then the buyer can identify the relevant Delivery.
  - Scenario: Unrelated update — Given the Delivery is outside the buyer's relationship, when an update is prepared, then no private Delivery information is disclosed.
  - Scenario: Delivery failure — Given an update cannot be delivered, when the buyer opens Nexa, then current Delivery facts remain available for refresh and no Delivery fact changes.
  - Scenario: Update retry — Given an update is repeated, when the buyer receives it, then it does not create a second Delivery, receipt or discrepancy fact.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** Four visible Gherkin scenarios; canonical catalog remains the behavior authority.
  - Scenario: Matching code — Given a valid unexpired code and authorized relationship, when the buyer verifies it, then Nexa identifies the matching Delivery and Attempt.
  - Scenario: Invalid code — Given the code is expired, reused, malformed or unrelated, when the buyer verifies it, then Nexa rejects it and changes no receipt fact.
  - Scenario: No connection — Given the code cannot be confirmed, when the buyer verifies it, then Nexa shows an unconfirmed state and no receipt succeeds.
  - Scenario: Verification boundary — Given the code is verified, when the buyer continues, then verification alone does not confirm quantities, POD, payment or Delivery completion.

  - Scenario: Matching receipt — Given a verified authorized handoff, when the buyer confirms received quantities, then Nexa records one Buyer receipt fact with person, time and Delivery.
  - Scenario: Different quantities — Given received quantities differ from the driver's outcome, when the buyer confirms them, then both facts remain separate and the difference is visible.
  - Scenario: Stale or reused handoff — Given the handoff is stale, expired or already used, when the buyer confirms quantities, then Nexa rejects the confirmation or returns its original result without a second receipt.
  - Scenario: No connection — Given receipt confirmation cannot be checked, when the buyer attempts it, then Nexa shows no receipt success until confirmation is received.

  - Scenario: Invalid report — Given reason, permission or required evidence is missing, when the buyer reports it, then Nexa records no unauthorized correction.
