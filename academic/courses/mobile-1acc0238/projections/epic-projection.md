# Academic Epic projection

> GENERATED ACADEMIC PROJECTION — DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY

This projection maps the seven academic compatibility Epics to the canonical
Mobile catalog. It preserves five V1 Epics and two V2+ projections; it does not
duplicate the full twelve-Epic Product runway. The complete Product Epic index
is [here](../../../../03-mobile/requirements/epics/README.md), and future stories
remain outside the academic course backlog. No Mobile Bounded Context or
client implementation is claimed.

## Dependency note

WEB-US-001, WEB-US-002, WEB-US-003, WEB-US-004 and WEB-US-005 Landing Page
stories remain a Sprint 1 dependency in the academic plan. They are not Mobile
stories and remain outside the Mobile Epic count.
