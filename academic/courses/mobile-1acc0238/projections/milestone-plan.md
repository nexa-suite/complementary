# Academic milestones and four-week plan

Official deadlines and owner delivery goals are separate. Dates are not
invented; the source provides week numbers, not calendar dates.

## Official milestone matrix

| Requirement / evidence | AV1 week 4 | TB1 week 7 | AV2 week 12 | TB2 week 15 | Current status | Evidence owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| About Product / About Team videos | PENDING | PENDING | FIRST VERSION | FINAL | No links or media claimed | Team |
| Bibliography: 4 recent Q1/Q2 papers | RESEARCH_PENDING | REFINE | REFINE | FINAL | No papers invented | Research |

## Owner four-week execution runway

| Week | Focus | Concrete output | Truth boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | Architecture and Product closure | Scope, epics, stories, AC, backlog, architecture questions, Android strategy, local-storage strategy, camera strategy, REST contract, third-party decision question, SPIKE-001, C4 Deployment, tactical projections | Documentation-ready only; no client completion claim |
| Week 2 | Android foundation | Kotlin project skeleton, architecture, authentication, Tenant/Workspace context, API client, i18n/a11y foundation, local persistence foundation, camera proof, first API integration | Target; implementation evidence required |
| Week 3 | Representative core flow | One Warehouse physical workflow, one Driver/Delivery workflow, API use, error/conflict behavior, physical-device run | Target; no result fabricated |
| Week 4 | AV1 readiness plus risk reduction | Requirements/DDD/architecture package and enough Android proof to expose risk | AV1 focuses requirements and architecture; device proof remains evidence gate |

## Sprint projection

| Sprint | Product outcome | Stories | Academic evidence | Sprint Goal template |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sprint 1 | Safe physical inventory execution plus Landing Page dependency | Existing Website stories WEB-US-001..005 in Sprint 1; Warehouse identifier, receiving, Lot, stock, FEFO, discrepancy plus context foundation | AV1 requirements/DDD; TB1 core screen and first implementation evidence | Our focus is on reliable warehouse execution and a demonstrable acquisition entry. We believe it delivers less inventory ambiguity to Warehouse Operators and a clear first step for a Prospect. This will be confirmed when the Website dependency is traceable and an allocated pick or receipt records authoritative FEFO, retry and conflict behavior. |
| Sprint 2 | Traceable dispatch, Delivery and Buyer handoff | Dispatch readiness, assignment, handoff, Driver Attempt, POD, QR, receipt and discrepancy | AV2 principal flows, validation-video candidate | Our focus is on traceable Delivery handoff. We believe it delivers clearer delivery outcomes to Drivers and Buyers. This will be confirmed when a physical handoff resolves securely and separate Driver and Buyer facts remain visible. |
| Sprint 3 | Buyer delivery handoff, receipt and critical updates | Buyer update, handoff verification, receipt and discrepancy | TB2 complete backlog, App Distribution and final evidence | Our focus is on completing a narrow truthful Buyer delivery flow. We believe it delivers clearer receipt and follow-up to Buyers. This will be confirmed when update, verification, receipt and discrepancy remain separate and the accepted distribution path shows no false authority. |

Sprint Goal text is an academic projection. No Sprint result, velocity or team
assignment is claimed here.
